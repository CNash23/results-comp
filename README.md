## My process

I made my sections, gave them a color and positioned them. Then added the content within each one. After doing this, I added styling and more detailed positioning of the contents within each section.

### Built with

- HTML
- - CSS Grid

### What I learned

I learned about the background-image linear gradient style attribute which makes blended colors. Fun!
I also learned more about using spans to isolate elements for precise positioning.

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  background-image: linear-gradient(
    hsla(256, 72%, 46%, 1),
    hsla(241, 72%, 46%, 0)
  );
}
```


### Continued development

I will continue to focus on learning more advanced HTML and CSS.
